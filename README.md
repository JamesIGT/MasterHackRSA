🔐 RSA Algorithm in Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the RSA encryption and decryption algorithm, one of the most widely used public-key cryptographic systems.

📜 Description
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm used for secure data transmission. It relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers and modular arithmetic.

This project demonstrates:

Generation of public and private RSA keys.

Encryption of plaintext messages using the public key.

Decryption of ciphertext messages using the private key.

Basic number theory functions (e.g., GCD, modular inverse, primality testing).

🛠 Features
Key generation with selectable key sizes

Basic encryption and decryption support for strings

Educational and beginner-friendly code structure

No external libraries required (pure Python)

📁 Files
functions.py – Main script containing the RSA implementation.

ex.py – Example usage script (encrypting and decrypting a message).
